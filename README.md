# MazeSolver

The base functionality of the project is to autogenerate a maze of the desired dimensions of the user and have it solved using the depth first search algorithm implemented in `./src/maze.py`.

Use `./main.sh` in the _CLI_ to start the application. </br>
Change `animation_delay_solve` and `animation_delay_create` in `maze.py` to change the speed of the animations implemented so the user can see the actual process. </br>
In `main.py` change `num_rows` and `num_cols` to adjust the maze dimenions and the variables under `#window size` to change the size of the actual window.
